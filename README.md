Description:

The purpose of creating my portfolio website was to display my capabilities as a developer in an easy to navigate, uncluttered design.

I created the nav bar to sit at the top of the screen in a horizontal line, with each nav item responding when the cursor is hovered over the icon.
I created a total of six pages - each designed with a clean aesthetic and simplicity of use in mind. I did this taking into account that prospective employers will be looking at a multitude of similar portfolio sites and that the less information they have to sift through to get to the content that matters to them - the better.

The site features a responsive, mobile first design, with a home page, about, skills, projects, blog and contact page. A download link to my resume is included in the 'about' section. The overall aesthetic is black and white, that responds in colour when certain elements are hovered over using the cursor. My design choice was to reflect - in part - my personality, as someone who may not come across as particularly flamboyant or interesting, but has a lot more to offer beneath the surface.

My target audience is purely for people in the web developer world, and my design reflects that, with reference to source code fonts and web-related images throughout the design.
